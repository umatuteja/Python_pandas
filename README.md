# Python_pandas_data_analysis project.

**Using Pandas and other Python libraries generate and communicate business insights from a grocery sales data set.**

A grocery sales company is looking for patterns in its sales data regarding regions, sales reps, and product categories. 
Conducted an analysis to surface notable patterns related to sales results.

**Requirements:**

●	Import data, including at least two DataFrames and at least one combination of DataFrames via methods such as joining.
●	Functions for cleaning the data set, with explanations for how null values are being handled in each field.
●	At least two visualizations accompanied by textual descriptions of the business insights they communicate.

**Process**

Followed this approach for addressing the above problem statement. 
1.	Cleaned the data with rationale-backed handling of null or missing values.
2.	Joined the data sets together into a single DataFrame.
3.	Analysed sales results and supply chain logistics in relation to other data points.

**After doing data analysis: Proposed a hypothesis around patterns and correlations revealed during the analysis.**
